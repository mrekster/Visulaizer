Visualizer is a 2D drawing and code-export tool built entirely in Python with Pygame.
It lets you create, edit, and manipulate shapes — lines, rectangles, circles, polygons — directly on a canvas, then export them as Pygame draw commands that you can paste into your own projects.

You can:

Draw and move shapes with the mouse.

Scale, rotate, colour, and duplicate them.

Snap them to a centred grid.

Adjust thickness interactively.

Toggle a demo mode for clean visual showcases.

Export your full scene as working Python code.


**Important:** You must download the entire folder, not just the Python file.
Visualizer uses image files (like the icon and splash logo) stored inside the same directory.
